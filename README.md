# CISCX82Doodler: IA08 and IA09
### Lily Yan

This assignment is a doodle app prototype for Android mobile devices. It was developed using Android Studio. To use the app, all you have to do is clone the repository, open the project on Android Studio, and run the app on your emulator (or on your Android device if you have one). I used the Pixel XL API 30 through the emulator.

The app allows for customizing color, brush size, and opacity. To start over, click the "CLEAR" button in the top left corner. To change the color, click the "COLOR" button in the center of the bottom toolbar. The labeled sliders for "Size" and "Opacity" can be used to change brush size and opacity respectively. 

NEW (Updated 12/10/24 for IA09): The app now has undo/redo functionality. The added undo/redo buttons allow the user to undo the most recently made stroke, and re-add the most recently removed stroke.

This app uses the AmbilWarna Library Android Color Picker tool, which can be found [here](https://github.com/yukuku/ambilwarna?tab=readme-ov-file).
